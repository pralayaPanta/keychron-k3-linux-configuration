# keychron-k3-linux-configuration
This is configuration for keychron k3 keyboard linux using bluetooth.

I bought Keyboard Keychron K3 recently, it did not work out of the box for my Pop OS. The bluetooth devices was not showing my device. This was working for Windows and Android devices. 

For my linux machine as well, it was working using cable.
